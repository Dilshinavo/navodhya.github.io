   <br><br><br>Playing is a natural and enjoyable way for children to keep active, stay well and be happy. 
   Freely chosen play helps children and young people’s healthy development. 
   To have good physical and mental health and to learn life skills,
   they need various unstructured play opportunities from birth until they’re teenagers.</div>
 </div><br>
 
 
  <b><h2>Why Play Is Importance</b></h2>
  <div class="text1">
Play improves the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and young people.
Through play, children learn about the world and themselves.
They also learn skills they need for study, work and relationships such as:
<ul>
   <li>confidence</li>
   <li>self-esteem</li>
   <li>social skills</li>
   <li>independence</li>
   <li>curiosity</li>
</ul>
</div><br><br> 
  
 <b><h2>Playful Parenting</b></h2>
 <div class="text2">
Through play, parents can connect fully with their children and have fun.  
A parent or carer can support and take part in their child’s play activities but they shouldn’t direct what happens.
It’s important they give their children time, freedom and choice to play. If an adult makes all the decisions about how, 
what and when their child plays, the child won’t enjoy their play experiences.<br><br><br>

<br><br>

<b><h2>Helping Your Child's Development Through Play</b></h2>
 <div class="text2">
 Playing helps children form essential skills. So making time for play every day is important. Parents and carers shouldn’t direct the play.
 They should allow their child to choose how, what and when they play. 
 They should encourage children to play outdoors often and where possible, join in the activity.<br><br>

 <b><h2>Playing At Different Ages</b></h2>
 <div class="text2">
 The urge to play begins when a child is born and lasts until adulthood. Babies, toddlers, 
children and teenagers have a natural instinct to play and be playful.
They need different types of play because they’re at various development stages and have different abilities.
A play experience might be easy for one child but challenging and difficult for another.

 <div id="new">
 <li><h3>New Born Baby To One Year-Old</h3> </li>
 <div class="pic2">
   <img src="one-year.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="text3">
    Babies can be demanding and need routine. To grow and develop, a baby needs stimulation and attention from someone
	who is happy to communicate and play with them.
    Playing with your child helps forms a bond between you. You don’t always need to buy toys to stimulate young babies.
    You can make your own or use ordinary objects, such as:
	<br><br>
	<ul type="circle">
   <li>scraps of fabric</li>
   <li>plastic beakers</li>
   <li>bunch of keys</li>
   <li>clean, empty boxes</li>
   <li>a small mirror</li>
   </ul>
<br>
 You can play with your baby and get their attention by:<br><br>
 <ul type="circle">
   <li>talking, singing, clapping, bouncing, crawling</li>
   <li>lying on the floor, kicking, tummy time, playing Peek-a-boo</li>
   <li>showing them brightly coloured objects with different sounds and textures</li>
   <li>allowing them to touch scraps of fabric, balls, rattles, soft books, empty boxes</li>
 </ul>

   <div class="text3">
    Children begin to explore and discover their surroundings when they’re between one and two years old.
	Most take their first steps and move around more. They enjoy repetition and are very curious about the world around them.
	They’re able to play a little by themselves but prefer playing with parents or adults. Time spent playing helps your child’s development. 
	Suitable playing activities to do with children this age include:
	<br><br>
	<ul type="circle">
   <li>movement games, singing, dancing, action rhymes</li>

 <li><h3>Children Aged Over Two Years</h3> </li>
 <div class="pic3">
   <img src="corkBLOG-PIC.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="text3">
    Children aged two to four are usually interested in everything that happens around them.
	They want to climb, balance, run and test their abilities.
    Sometimes parents worry about their child’s safety doing these activities.
    By supporting and encouraging your child to do things for themselves, they develop self-confidence and resilience.
    Suitable activities to play with children this age include:
	<br><br>
	<ul type="circle">
   <li>using paints and chalks</li>
   <li>dressing up with old clothes, hats, shoes, bags and beads</li>
   <li>baking, gardening, hanging out washing, playing outdoors</li>
   <li>playing match, sort and find games</li>

 <div class="pic4">
   <img src="child-5-12-years-2.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;">
   <div class="text3">
   Children between four and five years are often in a pre-school setting. 
   They have different routines and structures in their day. They’re becoming more independent, self-confident and inquisitive. 
   Usually they are content to play with their toys for longer, enjoy doing new things, and will play with or without an adult.
   Playing with your child is still lots of fun but you should encourage their freely chosen play.

 Suitable playing activities for children this age include:
	<br><br>
	<ul type="circle">
   <li>reading or looking at books</li>
   <li>simple games such as snap, i-spy, snakes and ladders, playing cards</li>
   <li>outdoor scavenger hunts, picnics, ball games, hide-and-seek</li>

 <b><h2>Some Games You Can Play With Your Kids</b></h2><br>
 <ol type="1">
 
    <div id="bt">
   <li><h3>Broken Telephone</h3></li>
   <div class="pic7">
   <img src="bt.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="game1">
   The Telephone Game can be played around the dinner table or anytime when at least 3 members of your family are present.<br>
Start with single words if your child is very young and slowly move up to phrases, then entire sentences as they become
 more competent at listening.<br>
Make up a word or sentence and whisper it into your child’s ear, who must whisper it to the next family member, 
who continues passing the message around the table. <br>The last person to hear the message says it out loud.
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>

   <div id="simon">
   <li><h3>Simon Says</h3></li>
   <div class="pic7">
   <img src="ssays.jpeg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="game1">
 The classic Simon Says game is excellent for making your child pay attention and listen to instructions.<br>
Call out instructions by saying, for example, “Simon Says put your hands on your shoulders.”<br>
 When you give an example that doesn’t begin with “Simon Says,” such as “Jump three times,” your child must not do it.<br>
This means that for each instruction, your child must listen for two details:
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>

 <div id="musical">
 <li><h3>Musical Chairs </h3></li>
   <div class="pic7">
   <img src="mchairs.jpg" alt="" style="float:left;">
   <div class="game1">
 The musical chairs game is another favourite that kids love. <br>
Play the music and have the players walk around the perimeter of the chair circle.<br>
When the music stops, everyone must immediately sit in a chair.<br>
The one person left standing it out.<br>
Remove another chair and continue until only one person is left.<br>
Remove one chair after each round but keep everyone in the game.<br> 
The challenge then is to get every player seated on a diminishing number of chairs. <br>
In other words, they have to share chairs. <br>
You will see the difference over time as your child refines their listening skills. <br>
Initially, it may take a while for your child to realize the music has paused and to sit on a chair.<br>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>


<li><h3>Matching Game</h3></li>
   <div class="pic7">
   <img src="match.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="game1">
Shuffle the cards well and spread them face down across the table.<br>
Players take turns to turn over two cards, searching for a matching pair. <br>
If the cards selected are a match, the player keeps the matching pair and takes another turn.<br>
 If they are not the same, the cards are turned back over in the same location and play moves to the next player.<br>
Once all cards have been matched, the player with the most pairs wins the game.<br>
For the cards, use simple images you can draw, shapes, letters or even colour cards for young kids.<br>

</div>
</div>
<br>


<li><h3>Hide and Seek</h3></li>
   <div class="pic7">
   <img src="hide-and-seek-two.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;">
   <div class="game1">
No list of indoor games would be complete without Hide and Seek.<br>
In this classic game,one person covers his or her eyes and counts aloud while the other players hide. <br>
When seeker is finished counting, seeker begins looking for the hiders. <br>
The last hider to be found is the next seeker. <br>
