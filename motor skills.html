   <br><br><br>Fine motor skills activities use movement to develop the small hand muscles in children. 
   It’s essential to use activities for fine motor skills in early learners to prepare their hands for fiddly things.
   For example, writing, zipping, shoe tying, and so much more.</div>

Practicing Fine Motor Skills Activity Through Play is Critical for Development
These fine motor skills activities will give your child a huge advantage in writing when they are ready. 
It will prep the small hand muscles for proper pencil grip and letter formation. 
Give these fine motor skills activities for toddlers a go and watch them have fun!

 <b><h2>Importance Of Fine Motor Skills</b></h2>
 <div class="text2">
Fine motor skills involve the use of the small muscles that control the hand, fingers, and thumb.
 They help children perform important tasks like feeding themselves, grasping toys, buttoning and zipping clothes, writing, drawing, and more. 
The ability to complete self-care and every day tasks helps a child’s self esteem and confidence to increase.
It’s important to start working with children on building their fine motor skills early on. 
Fine motor skills will develop and improve as they move through childhood. It just takes the right kind of practice. 
Some children may struggle with performing tasks that use their fine motor skills. 
This can cause them to become frustrated and upset when they can’t complete every day tasks. For example, a child may have a difficult time holding scissors and cutting along a dotted line.
 This could cause them to be frustrated at the task and avoid cutting exercises because they feel it’s too difficult.

<b><h2>Some Activities For Build Motor Skills</b></h2>
 <div class="text2">
 <ul>
 <li><h4> Play-Dough</h4> </li>
     Play-dough is often used as part of the heavy work component of a sensory diet.
	 They can also help improve a child’s fine motor skills. Encourage your child to squeeze, stretch, pinch and roll “snakes” or “worms”
	 with the play clay. 
	 You can even have your child try to cut the play-dough with scissors.<br><br><br>

 <li><h4>Painting</h4></li> 
     Different types of painting can help strengthen your child’s hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity. 
	 Finger painting gives kids an opportunity to use their hands — and to get messy.
	 Painting with a brush helps kids learn to hold a brush and gain greater control using it as a tool.
	 To add a little sensory play to the mix, you can even try scratch-and-sniff painting.<br><br><br>

 <li><h4> Playing with sponges</h4></li> 
     A new clean sponge, some water and two bowls are all you need for another activity to build fine motor skills. 
	 Fill a bowl with water and leave the other empty. 
	 Your child can soak the sponge in the water and then squeeze out the sponge into the other bowl.
	 It’s a simple game that can strengthen hands and forearms. 
	 If you cut off a cube of the sponge and have a small chalkboard and some chalk,
	 you can also do a “Wet-Dry-Try” multisensory handwriting activity.<br><br><br>

 <li><h4> Water play</h4></li> 
   Fill a cup about a quarter full of water. Give your child an empty cup and an eyedropper or a clean medicine syringe. 
   Have your child try to transfer the water from one cup to the other by drawing the water into the dropper or syringe 
   and then dropping or squirting it into the empty cup.
   You could also give your child more cups, add food coloring to the water, and make this a color-mixing experiment. <br><br><br>

	 <li><h4>Gardening and planting</h4></li> 
 Digging and gardening may seem like activities more suited to building gross motor skills, but there are parts of it 
 that require smaller muscle control, too.
 For instance, transferring seedlings into a garden requires hand-eye coordination skills to safely carry the smaller
 plant to the new hole. 
 Your child will also need to be able to grasp a trowel to dig and to use a pincer grasp when picking up seeds to plant. <br><br><br>
