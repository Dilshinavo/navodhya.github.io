They are called "Mass Media" in general.
Some of them are Television, Radio, Newspapers, and the Internet.

 have been using their computers and tablets at home well before they started school. As kids are
 learning from a very young age about technology,
 they’re making huge strides as they grow in being prepared for schooling and more.

 concerns<br> about how this tech impacts childhood development positvely and negatively.

	  They can also play along with children to include face-to-face interactions with technology, 
	  and make sure that tech doesn’t interfere for opportunities to play.</li> <br>
      <li>Parents can watch for quality apps and tv proggrams that promote vocabulary, math, literacy, and science.</li> <br>
      <li>Develop a customized media use plan for your children.</li> <br>
